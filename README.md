My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I started with just Kotlin (my preferred languge), but later I decided it was also a good opportunity to practice some other languages, so I added Rust and Go (which is in [a different repo](https://github.com/ean5533/aoc-2021-go) since I couldn't work through Go being extremely finicky about paths).
